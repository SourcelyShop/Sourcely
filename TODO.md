IDEAS:

For a premium account on a digital asset marketplace like Resourced, you want features that offer status, visibility, and personal branding.

Here are some high-impact customization ideas:

1. Visual Dominance (Status)
Animated Profile Picture & Banner: Allow them to upload GIFs or WebM files for their avatar and cover image. Motion catches the eye immediately.
Glowing Name/Frame: A subtle neon glow effect around their username or avatar in comments and listings.
Custom Color Themes: Let them pick a "Brand Color" (e.g., Cyberpunk Pink, Gold, Electric Blue) that overrides the default accent color on their profile page and asset pages.
2. Listing Superpowers (Visibility)
"Verified" or "Pro" Badge: A distinct checkmark or icon that signals trust.
Video Covers: Allow them to use a short video loop as the main thumbnail for their assets in the search grid (instead of a static image).
Rich Text Descriptions: Unlock advanced formatting (embedded YouTube videos, tables, colored text) for their asset descriptions.
3. Vanity & Branding
Custom URL: resourced.io/u/DesignGod instead of resourced.io/u/12345-xyz.
Pinned Assets: Let them pin their best-selling or favorite 3 assets to the very top of their profile.
My Recommendation: Start with Custom Color Themes and Animated Avatars. They are visually striking and make the user feel like they "own" their space on your platform.

Do any of these sound like the direction you want to go?
